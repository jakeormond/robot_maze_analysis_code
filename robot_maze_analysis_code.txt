rename_bonsai_files.py		Fixes the datestamp issue with Bonsai, where it is always one 
				filename behind the honeycomb task script. Uses the times when 
				the files were modified to correctly match them. 
				RUN THIS BEFORE RUNNING ANY OTHER CODE!!!!!


process_dlc_data.py		Extracts the positional data from deeplabcut
				NOTE THAT POSITIONAL DATA NEEDS TO BE TRIMMED AT START AND END!!!
				THIS CAN BE DONE WHEN PROCESSING NEURAL DATA. 
				
create_videos_with_dlc_data.py	Produces videos with a red arrow tracking head position and direction. 

extract_pulses_from_raw.py	Finds the digital pulses emitted by Bonsai and recorded by SpikeGLX 
				by reading the final channel of the binary file. 

get_pulses.py			Reads in the pulse timings recorded by Bonsai, and matches them to the 
				pulses read from the SpikeGLX data. It produces plots to allow the 
				user to confirm that the SpikeGLX pulses are correctly aligned to the 
				Bonsai data. The Bonsai pulses (in computer time (ms)) and the SpikeGLX 
				pulses (in samples) are combined into a 2d array and saved as a list of 
				arrays as an H5 file.
